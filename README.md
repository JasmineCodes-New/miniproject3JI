## Description
This project will be using Flask to create a simple web app called Jasmine's Flask Blog. It makes use of Python, Flask,
and Bootstrap CSS. 

## Pip Install Instructions
It is essential you run this command so all the required installs are imported to your computer.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How To Run
If you want to run in the terminal, please type the following:
```
flask --app flaskr run --debug
``` 

## Initialize the Database

I recommend you run the initialization for the database then the flask run command. If you have trouble 
with the command, create another virtual environment in your pycharm for this project.
